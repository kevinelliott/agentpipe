# Issue Response: Are we missing any AI agent CLIs that are out there?

**Research Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Researcher:** GitHub Copilot Agent  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## TL;DR - Quick Answer

**YES, we're missing some notable ones!** üéØ

The top 3 most significant omissions are:
1. ‚≠ê **Aider** (18,000+ stars) - Most popular open-source AI coding assistant
2. ‚≠ê **Mentat** (2,500+ stars) - Direct file editing approach
3. ‚≠ê **GPT Engineer** (52,000+ stars) - Whole-project generation

AgentPipe currently has **excellent coverage** of commercial and emerging tools (15 agents), but could benefit from adding these popular open-source alternatives.

## Current State of AgentPipe

### What We Support Today (15 Agents)

**CLI-Based Agents (14):**
1. Amp (Sourcegraph) - Advanced coding with thread management
2. Claude (Anthropic) - Advanced reasoning and coding
3. Codex (OpenAI) - Code generation specialist
4. Copilot (GitHub) - Terminal-based coding agent
5. Crush (Charm) - Terminal-first AI assistant
6. Cursor (Cursor AI) - IDE-integrated assistance
7. Factory (Factory.ai) - Agent-native development
8. Gemini (Google) - Multimodal understanding
9. Groq - Fast AI powered by LPUs
10. Kimi (Moonshot AI) - Interactive AI agent
11. OpenCode (SST) - Terminal coding agent
12. Qoder - Enhanced context engineering
13. Qwen (Alibaba) - Multilingual capabilities
14. Ollama - Local LLM support

**API-Based Agents (1):**
15. OpenRouter - Access to 400+ models

### What We're Missing

After comprehensive research of the AI agent CLI ecosystem, I identified several notable tools that AgentPipe doesn't currently support.

## Recommended Additions

### Tier 1: High Priority - Should Definitely Add

#### 1. Aider ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Why:** Most popular open-source AI coding assistant  
**Stats:** 18,000+ GitHub stars  
**Unique Feature:** Git-aware coding with auto-commits  
**Integration Effort:** LOW (1-2 days)  
**Install:** `pip install aider-chat`  
**CLI Quality:** Excellent (stdin/stdout, `--message` flag)

**What makes it special:**
- Automatically commits changes to git
- Works with multiple LLM providers (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Multi-file editing capabilities
- Large active community

**Example use case:**
```yaml
agents:
  - type: aider
    name: "Git Developer"
    prompt: "Make changes and commit them with clear messages"
```

#### 2. Mentat ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Why:** Alternative approach to AI pair programming  
**Stats:** 2,500+ GitHub stars  
**Unique Feature:** Direct file editing (autonomous changes)  
**Integration Effort:** LOW (1-2 days)  
**Install:** `pip install mentat`  
**CLI Quality:** Excellent (CLI-first design)

**What makes it special:**
- Writes code directly to files (vs. Aider's collaborative approach)
- Git integration for tracking changes
- Multi-file refactoring support
- Different workflow than existing agents

**Why add both Aider and Mentat?**
They have similar goals but different approaches:
- **Aider:** Collaborative, interactive git commits
- **Mentat:** Autonomous, direct file writing
Both are valuable for different workflows.

#### 3. GPT Engineer ‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY
**Why:** Most popular project generation tool  
**Stats:** 52,000+ GitHub stars (!)  
**Unique Feature:** Whole-project generation from prompts  
**Integration Effort:** MEDIUM (2-3 days)  
**Install:** `pip install gpt-engineer`  
**CLI Quality:** Good (CLI-first, may need adaptation)

**What makes it special:**
- Generates entire projects from specifications
- Iterative development mode
- Different use case than code editing tools
- Excellent for bootstrapping new projects

**Example use case:**
```yaml
agents:
  - type: gpt-engineer
    name: "Architect"
    prompt: "Generate well-structured project foundations"
  
  - type: claude
    name: "Reviewer"
    prompt: "Review generated code for best practices"
```

### Tier 2: Medium Priority - Worth Considering

#### 4. Cody (Sourcegraph) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** From Amp's parent company, strong codebase understanding  
**Stats:** 2,500+ GitHub stars  
**Integration Effort:** MEDIUM (requires Sourcegraph CLI)  
**Install:** Part of `sg` CLI  
**Command:** `sg cody chat`

#### 5. Anthropic API (Direct) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Official API vs. CLI wrapper  
**Type:** API-based (like OpenRouter)  
**Integration Effort:** LOW (reuse OpenRouter pattern)  
**Benefits:** Better rate limits, more features, official support

#### 6. OpenAI API (Direct) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Direct GPT access  
**Type:** API-based  
**Integration Effort:** LOW  
**Note:** We already have Codex CLI, but direct API offers more control

## What We Should NOT Add (and Why)

Several tools were evaluated but are not recommended:

- **Tabnine** - IDE plugin focus, poor CLI support
- **Continue.dev** - Better as VS Code extension, complex LSP integration
- **Tabby** - Server-based architecture, not CLI-friendly
- **Sweep** - GitHub App, not conversational
- **Devin** - Closed beta, no CLI/API
- **Replit Agent** - Web-based only
- **bolt.new** - Web-based only

---

## Impact Analysis

### If We Add Top 3 (Aider, Mentat, GPT Engineer)

**Coverage Improvement:**
- Current: 15 agents
- After: 18 agents
- **+20% increase**

**New Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Git-aware coding (Aider)
- ‚úÖ Direct file editing (Mentat)
- ‚úÖ Project generation (GPT Engineer)

**Market Position:**
- Would have **most comprehensive multi-agent platform**
- Only platform supporting Aider + Mentat + GPT Engineer together
- Clear differentiation from competitors

**User Segments Unlocked:**
- Aider users (large open-source community)
- Mentat users (alternative workflow preference)
- GPT Engineer users (project bootstrapping)

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. **Aider** - Days 1-2 (highest demand, lowest effort)
2. **Mentat** - Days 3-4 (similar to Aider, quick win)

### Phase 2: Expand Coverage (2-3 weeks)
3. **GPT Engineer** - Days 5-7 (different workflow, medium effort)
4. **Cody** - Days 8-10 (if community interest)

### Phase 3: API Expansion (2-3 weeks)
5. **Anthropic API** - Days 11-13 (direct provider access)
6. **OpenAI API** - Days 14-16 (direct GPT access)

---

## How to Proceed

### Option A: Implement All Top 3
**Time:** 3-5 weeks  
**Impact:** Major improvement in coverage  
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Recommended

### Option B: Start with Aider Only
**Time:** 1-2 days  
**Impact:** Addresses most requested missing agent  
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Good for quick validation

### Option C: Community Decision
**Time:** Variable  
**Impact:** Based on feedback  
**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è May want to validate demand first
