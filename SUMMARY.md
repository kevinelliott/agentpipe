## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive analysis of the AgentPipe codebase that identified **12 distinct issues** spanning security vulnerabilities, concurrency bugs, memory leaks, and performance concerns.

### Key Findings

- **1 HIGH-severity security vulnerability** requiring immediate attention
- **6 MEDIUM-severity issues** affecting reliability and security
- **5 LOW-severity enhancements** for code quality improvement
- **3 security-related issues** total (API keys, file permissions)
- **2 concurrency bugs** that could lead to race conditions
- **2 resource management issues** (memory leaks, unbounded retries)

---

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### üö® Issue #2: API Key Logging Risk (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Impact:** API keys could be exposed in log files, error output, or crash dumps, leading to unauthorized access.

**Location:** `internal/bridge/client.go` and `pkg/client/openai_compat.go`

**Required Action:** Implement API key redaction in all error messages and logging paths.

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing fixes:

1. **Run race detector**: `go test -race ./...`
2. **Security testing**: Verify no API keys in logs/errors
3. **Stress testing**: Test with high MaxRetries configuration
4. **File permissions**: Verify all created files have correct permissions
5. **Edge cases**: Test with malformed inputs (negative values, huge texts)
6. **Concurrency**: Test multi-threaded orchestrator usage
7. **Resource cleanup**: Verify no memory leaks in long-running scenarios
