# Issue 1
gh issue create \
  --title "Race Condition in Orchestrator Message History" \
  --label "bug,concurrency,medium-priority" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Severity
Medium

## Category  
Concurrency Bug

## Description
The `getAgentResponse` method in `pkg/orchestrator/orchestrator.go` has a race condition when accessing message history and updating the current turn number. Messages are read without a lock (via `getMessages()` at line 767), then after processing, the lock is acquired to append new messages (lines 956-962). Between these operations, concurrent access could lead to inconsistent state.

## Location
- **File:** `pkg/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- **Lines:** 746-1000

## Code Example
\`\`\`go
// Line 767: Messages read without lock (inside getMessages)
messages := o.getMessages()

// ... processing happens ...

// Lines 956-962: Lock acquired here, but state might have changed
o.mu.Lock()
o.messages = append(o.messages, msg)
currentTurn := o.currentTurnNumber
o.currentTurnNumber++
bridgeEmitter := o.bridgeEmitter
o.mu.Unlock()
\`\`\`

## Impact
- Incorrect message ordering in multi-threaded scenarios
- Turn number mismatches in metrics/logging
- Potential data races when using streaming bridge

## Recommended Fix
Hold the lock throughout the entire operation or ensure atomicity of read-modify-write cycles.

## Risk Assessment
**Medium**: While orchestrator methods are typically called sequentially, the concurrent-safe design with RWMutex suggests multi-threaded use is intended.

# Issue 2  
gh issue create \
  --title "Security: API Key Logging Risk in Bridge Client" \
  --label "security,high-priority,bug" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Severity
**HIGH**

## Category
Security Vulnerability

## Description
The bridge client includes API keys in HTTP headers without explicit protection against logging. No safeguard prevents accidental exposure in error messages or debug output.

## Location
- **File:** `internal/bridge/client.go`
- **Lines:** 108-136, 324-327

## Impact - CRITICAL
API keys could be exposed in:
- Log files (`~/.agentpipe/chats/`)
- Error output to stderr/stdout
- Debug logs when `LogLevel: "debug"`
- Crash dumps or panic traces

## Recommended Fix
1. Add explicit API key redaction in error messages
2. Never log full requests/responses that include headers
3. Add unit tests verifying keys are never in error strings

## Risk Assessment
**HIGH**: API key exposure could lead to unauthorized access and API abuse.
